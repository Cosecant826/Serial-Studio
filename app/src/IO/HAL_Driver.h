 * @class HAL_Driver
 * @brief Abstract base class for hardware abstraction layer drivers.
 *
 * This interface defines the core API for all I/O drivers in the system.
 * It provides methods for opening, closing, and checking the state of the
 * device, as well as sending and receiving data.
 *
 * The class includes a high-efficiency buffered data processing mechanism
 * through `processData()`, which reduces signal overhead in high-frequency
 * environments by aggregating data until a configurable buffer threshold is
 * reached.
 *
 * Once the threshold is met, the data is emitted via `dataReceived()`.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the pure virtual methods to handle specific device
 * protocols and behavior.
 *
 * Thread safety is ensured for buffer operations, making `processData()` safe
 * to call from multiple threads.
 *
 * @note Emitting signals across threads requires connected slots to handle
 *       queued events properly.
 *
 * @see setBufferSize(), processData(), flushBuffer()
